Happy Camper

This is my submission for the Udacity FSND Project 6: Neighborhood Map. I love to camp and I wanted to share a few of my favorite spots. 
It was made using google maps and foursquare APIs. The framework is KnockoutJS. 

To run it locally, you need to follow these instructions:
1. Clone to your github desktop or download the zip file
2. If you've chosen to download the file, extract the files from the zip file
3. Once finished, make your way to the 'src' folder
4. When in the 'src' folder, navigate to the index.html file. Open it in a text editor of your choice and scroll down to line 50
5. Once there, you will see the GoogleAPI link. I have removed my MAPKEY and this will allow you to input your own
(I have marked where you need to input your key as YOURKEYHERE so its easy to see!)
6. To get your own GoogleAPI key, head here!
7. Once you have your key, have it take the place of YOURKEYHERE and then open the index.html file in the browser of your choice
8. You did it!
