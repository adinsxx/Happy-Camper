# Happy Camper

<h1>Hello!</h1>

If you love the outdoors like me, you'll no doubt enjoy this app.
I'm always looking for new campgrounds for the summer because I live in the midwest and summer lasts 4, maybe 5 months. 
So I created an application that would make that easier for me! Here's how you can use it:

<h3>Step 1: Clone to your github desktop or download the zip file of this application to your computer. 
(If you chose the zip file, make sure to extract the files after its been downloaded so they can be used)</h3>

<h3>Step 2: Get into the folder and click on the 'index.html' file.</h3>

Similarly, the app can be viewed here: https://adinsxx.github.io/Happy-Camper/

<h3>Step 3: This should take you to an application that is zeroed in on beautiful Wisconsin.</h3>

<h3>Step 4: Now, currently there are only 5 camping spots, but you can play around with the hide and show features on the application,
as well as the drawing tools!</h3>

In the coming days and weeks, I will be adding in more campsites to expand. I hope you enjoy playing around with the application!
